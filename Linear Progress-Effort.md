* Most people assume that the relationship between effort and reward is one to one. We think that working twice as long we will get twice as much done. We think that we spend twice as much time with somebody they will feel twice as loved.
* Linear curves only exist for mindless, rote, repetitive tasks, like filling out paperwork, or driving a car, or making widgets in a factory. In all these cases, somebody who does it for two hours is going to likely double the output of somebody who does it for one hour.
