## Features

* Writing notes
* Organizing information into folders
* Connecting thoughts: The human brain is non-linear and non-hierarchical ; we jump from idea to idea, all the time. My second brain should work the same.
	* Backlinks: Link relevant pages frictionlessly with one click.
	* Outgoing links: See all existing and potential links from a note. Turn mentions into links with one click.
	* Graph view: The graph is my knowledge at a glance. With group, filter, and display options, I can see things my way. Local graph shows connections around you. Great for inspiration while writing.
* Personally control and own my data: Notes live on my device, period. I can encrypt them or back them up however I want.
* Futureproof: Uses the standard and well-adopted markdown format, and works on top of a local folder of plain text files.
* Extensible: Plugins, themes, and custom CSS are at my disposal.
* Availability: Obsidian works completely offline, internet or service issues will never be a problem.
* Community: With more than 70,000 members in Discord and 35,000 members on their forum, Obsidian has one of the largest note-taking communities.
* Publishing: With Obsidian publish, you have a low-code option to publishing notes online with a polished UI that preserves your hyperlinks.
