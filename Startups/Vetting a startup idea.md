## Goal

Eliminate bad ideas rather than testing whether an idea possesses the traits of a "good" idea. 

## Strategy

You vet by conducting loads of research. Includes desk research, user interviews, talking to experts, etc.

Like science, you're trying to invalidate the idea through a series of stress tests with a range of opinions and user feedback.

Don't be in stealth mode, it hurts your ability to get input, and there's a history of companies that do miserably because they were isolated from feedback during development

Apply the “6-week rule”: If you get to 6 weeks with an idea and you don’t think its stupid, its a sign it has long-term potential

## Evaluation

3Ms:
* Market : Is there a market for the idea
* Momentum : Is the wind blowing in the direction of the market or problem
* Motivation : Are you motivated to work on the problem? You need to be motivated to fight the inevitable upstream battles

## Risks

* Target one idea-problem pairing at a time.
