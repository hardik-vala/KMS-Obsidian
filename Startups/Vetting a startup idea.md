## Goal

Eliminate bad ideas rather than testing whether an idea possesses the traits of a "good" idea. 

## Strategy

You vet by conducting loads of research. Includes desk research, user interviews, talking to experts, etc.

Like science, you're trying to invalidate the idea through a series of stress tests with a range of opinions and user feedback. Types of input:
* Experts: Know about historical truths 

Don't be in stealth mode, it hurts your ability to get input, and there's a history of companies that do miserably because they were isolated from feedback during development

Apply the “6-week rule”: If you get to 6 weeks with an idea and you don’t think its stupid, its a sign it has long-term potential

## Evaluation

3Ms:
* Market : Is there a market for the idea
* Momentum : Is the wind blowing in the direction of the market or problem
* Motivation : Are you motivated to work on the problem? You need to be motivated to fight the inevitable upstream battles

## Risks

* Target one idea-problem pairing at a time. Vetting requires going deep and you can only go deep by being immersed in the problem niche. It's better to aggressively target a single focus and drive to a yes/no decision as soon as possible. This is opposed to splintering research and/or trying to build a broad, horizontal product aiming to serve multiple use cases.
* Bias: It's easy to fall victim to the emotional swings at the early stages, e.g. over-rotating on negative input or face serious sunk cost fallacy despite contrary feedback - Try to stay objective.
	* Confirmation bias: Common sense is an ideal antidote.
	* Rarely can you be a renegade when everybody else is poo poo-ing your idea.
	* Bias is everywhere so constantly be aware and guard against it.
