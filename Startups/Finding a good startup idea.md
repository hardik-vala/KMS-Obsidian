1. Identify a market - This is going to be your search space.
2. Then pick an idea as a starting point ([[Finding a startup idea]]). It doesn't have to be well-researched, just use your best guess. Don't spend a lot of time analyzing the best selection. Just use your best judgement based on the knowledge you have. It's likely going to be a bad idea, but the insights you gain while vetting the idea will lead you to a good idea.
3. Then vet the idea ([[Vetting a startup idea]]) and if it gets proven wrong, then repeat 2. Otherwise, get ready to start a company.
