1. Identify a market - This is going to be your search space. Do research into the industry to understand its current state and identify any challenges it faces. Look for trends, patterns, and common pain points among all stakeholders (e.g. consumers).
2. Then pick an idea as a starting point ([[Finding a startup idea]]). It doesn't have to be well-researched, just use your best guess. Don't spend a lot of time analyzing the best selection. Just use your best judgement based on the knowledge you have. It's likely going to be a bad idea, but the insights you gain while vetting the idea will lead you to a good idea.
3. Then vet the idea ([[Vetting a startup idea]]) and if it gets proven wrong, then repeat 2. Otherwise, get ready to start a company.
