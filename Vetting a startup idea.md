## Goal

Eliminate bad ideas rather then testing whether an idea posesses  the 


You vet by conducting loads of research. Includes desk research, user interviews, talking to experts, etc.
* Like science, you're trying to invalidate the idea through a series of stress tests with a range of opinions and user feedback.
* Don't be in stealth mode, it hurts your ability to get input, and there's a history of companies that do miserably because they were isolated from feedback during development
* Apply the “6-week rule”: If you get to 6 weeks with an idea and you don’t think its stupid, its a sign it has long-term potential
* Evaluation: Use the 3Ms: Market (is there a market for the idea), momentum (is the wind blowing in the direction of the market or problem), motivation (are you motivated to work on the problem, because you need to be motivated to fight the inevitable upstream battles)
